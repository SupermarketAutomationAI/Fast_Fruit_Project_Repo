# Fast_Fruit_Project_Repo
This project makes use of the FasterRCNN Computer Vision algorithm to count and detect fruits in images under varying conditions. The core motivation of this project is to use the recent advances of machine learning to address the long wait times in grocery stores. According to a study by Dalhousie University, Canadians visit their local grocery store 1.3 times per week and spend an average of 32 minutes inside. Additionally, other studies have shown that these longer wait times are such an inconvenience that customers are willing to drive further distances for faster checkout times. The results of this project would be a step towards the full automation of supermarkets, enabling faster checkout times and improving the shopping experience.
